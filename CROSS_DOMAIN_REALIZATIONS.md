## The Scale Ladder of Integrity

A single kernel applied to 357 objects across 6 scales:

| Scale | N | ⟨F⟩ | ⟨IC⟩ | IC/F | ⟨Δ⟩ | Character |
|-------|--:|------|------|------|------|-----------|
| Fundamental (quarks/leptons/bosons) | 17 | 0.558 | 0.326 | 0.506 | 0.232 | Half coherent |
| Composite (hadrons) | 14 | 0.444 | 0.011 | 0.022 | 0.433 | Geometric slaughter |
| Atoms (periodic table, 8-ch) | 118 | 0.416 | 0.334 | 0.784 | 0.081 | High coherence |
| Cross-scale (nuclear-informed, 12-ch) | 118 | 0.516 | 0.384 | 0.737 | 0.132 | Nuclear channels add noise |
| Everyday physics (materials/waves) | 84 | 0.380 | 0.195 | 0.437 | 0.185 | Mixed coherence |
| Cosmological (universe epochs) | 6 | 0.597 | 0.105 | 0.174 | 0.492 | Dark energy devastation |

The IC/F column is the ladder's spine. It tells you what fraction of fidelity
survives as multiplicative coherence:

```
Atoms (8-ch)          ████████████████████████████████████████  0.784
Cross-scale (12-ch)   ██████████████████████████████████████    0.737
Fundamental           ██████████████████████████                0.506
Everyday physics      ██████████████████████                    0.437
Cosmological          █████████                                 0.174
Composite (hadrons)   █                                         0.022
```

## Realization 1: The Confinement Cliff Is a 23× Drop

**Receipt**: Fundamental IC/F = 0.506 → Composite IC/F = 0.022.

The ratio drops by a factor of **23** at the quark→hadron boundary. This is
not a statistical effect — it is geometric slaughter (trucidatio geometrica).
When quarks bind into hadrons, certain channels (color charge for color-neutral
hadrons) collapse to ε ≈ 10⁻⁸. One dead channel multiplied into the geometric
mean destroys IC regardless of how healthy the other channels are.

**Mechanism (from §3 of orientation)**:
- 8 channels, equal weight (1/8 each)
- One channel at ε: contributes ln(10⁻⁸)/8 = −2.30 to κ
- IC = exp(κ) ≈ exp(−2.30) ≈ 0.10 — even if 7 other channels are perfect

**Specific particles**:
- Up quark: IC/F = 0.94 (channels alive)
- Proton: IC/F = 0.04 (confinement cliff)
- Pion⁰: IC/F = 0.002 (worst — neutral + light = multiple dead channels)

**Confinement is not containment. It is the destruction of multiplicative
coherence at a phase boundary.** The physics word is "confinement." The kernel
word is "integrity cliff." The Latin names it: *praecipitium integritatis*.

---

## Realization 2: Atoms Heal What Confinement Breaks

**Receipt**: Composite IC/F = 0.022 → Atomic IC/F = 0.784.

A 35× recovery. After confinement destroys integrity at the hadron scale, the
atomic scale restores it with **new degrees of freedom** that didn't exist for
hadrons: electronegativity, ionization energy, atomic radius, melting point,
boiling point, density.

These emergent channels are:
1. Well-populated for most elements (no dead channels except noble gases)
2. Correlated through shared electron physics
3. Measured across all 118 elements

The insight: **ruptura est fons constantiae** — the rupture at one scale is
the source of constancy at the next. Hadron confinement breaks integrity;
the periodic table mends it with fresh structure.

**Period-by-period recovery**:

| Period | Elements | IC/F |
|--------|----------|------|
| 1 | H, He | 0.056 |
| 2 | Li–Ne | 0.468 |
| 3 | Na–Ar | 0.714 |
| 4 | K–Kr | 0.844 |
| 5 | Rb–Xe | 0.870 |
| 6 | Cs–Rn | 0.824 |
| 7 | Fr–Og | 0.803 |

Period 1 (H, He) is near-hadron level — too few channels, too few measurable
properties. By Period 4–5, IC/F peaks above 0.84 as the 8-channel trace
becomes fully populated. Then it dips slightly in Period 6–7 as f-block
elements introduce mild heterogeneity.

---

## Realization 3: d-Block Supremacy — Transition Metals Are the Most Coherent Elements

**Receipt**: d-block IC/F = 0.887, versus s-block = 0.675, p-block = 0.669, f-block = 0.842.

| Block | N | ⟨F⟩ | ⟨IC⟩ | IC/F | ⟨Δ⟩ |
|-------|--:|------|------|------|------|
| d-block | 38 | 0.519 | 0.461 | 0.887 | 0.058 |
| f-block | 30 | 0.406 | 0.343 | 0.842 | 0.063 |
| p-block | 36 | 0.382 | 0.262 | 0.669 | 0.120 |
| s-block | 14 | 0.245 | 0.160 | 0.675 | 0.085 |

**Why d-block dominates**: Transition metals have *every channel well-populated*.
High electronegativity, moderate ionization energy, high density, high melting
points, moderate boiling points. No single channel collapses to near-zero. The
d-orbital electrons create properties that are balanced across all measurement
dimensions.

**Why s-block fails**: Alkali metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr) have extreme
properties — very low ionization energy, very low electronegativity, low
density (relative to atomic mass) — creating dead channels that trigger
geometric slaughter. Cesium (Z=55) is the 4th-worst element by IC.

**Top 5 most coherent elements**: Rg (Z=111), Ds (Z=110), Mt (Z=109), Hs (Z=108), Rf (Z=104). **All superheavy d-block elements.** Their synthetic nature means
all measured properties are high and balanced.

**Bottom 5**: He (Z=2), H (Z=1), Ne (Z=10), Cs (Z=55), Ar (Z=18). Noble gases
dominate — missing electronegativity and electron affinity kill IC.

---

## Realization 4: Helium — The Most Incoherent Element in Existence

**Receipt**: He (Z=2): F = 0.317, IC = 0.007, IC/F = 0.022, Δ = 0.309.

Helium is **simpler** than any other element. Two protons, two neutrons, two
electrons, full 1s shell, no chemistry. One might expect simplicity to produce
coherence. The kernel says the opposite.

**Why**: Helium's noble gas nature means:
- No electronegativity (or near-zero)
- No electron affinity
- No liquid phase at normal pressure

These are three dead channels. With 8 channels total, three near-ε values
produce: κ = Σ wᵢ ln(cᵢ) → 3/8 × ln(10⁻⁸) ≈ −6.9, so IC ≈ 0.001.

**Simplicity ≠ coherence.** Coherence requires *balanced measurability
across all channels*. Helium is not balanced — it is inert, which means
several measurement dimensions return near-zero. Inertness IS the channel
death mechanism at the atomic scale.

---

## Realization 5: Magic Numbers Are Irrelevant to Multiplicative Coherence

**Receipt**: Magic elements IC/F = 0.741, Non-magic IC/F = 0.737.

Nuclear physicists revere magic numbers (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126) because
they correspond to nuclear shell closures — extra stability from filled
nuclear shells. The kernel reveals that this stability is **invisible to
multiplicative coherence**.

**Why**: Magic proximity is the #1 IC killer channel (39% of elements have it
as their weakest channel). But magic number elements don't benefit because:
1. Shell closure improves *one* channel (stability/binding energy)
2. Other channels (EA, T_melt, density_log) are independent of nuclear structure
3. IC requires *all* channels to be healthy — improving one doesn't help if
   others are already the bottleneck

**Binding energy per nucleon vs IC**: r = 0.157 (almost no correlation).
Nuclear binding energy and atomic-scale multiplicative coherence are
essentially independent quantities. This makes physical sense: BE/A is a
nuclear property; IC is a cross-channel property that includes electronic
and bulk properties.

---

## Realization 6: Wave Systems — The Peak of Everyday Coherence

**Receipt**: Top 5 IC/F in everyday physics are **all wave phenomena** (IC/F > 0.93).

| Domain | IC/F | Character |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Wave phenomena | 0.645 | Broadly coherent |
| Optics | 0.619 | Light is balanced |
| Thermodynamics | 0.378 | Thermal extremes create gaps |
| Electromagnetism | 0.065 | Conductor/insulator split devastates IC |

**Why waves dominate**: Wave systems (acoustic resonance, seismic waves,
ocean waves, electromagnetic standing waves) have *inherently balanced
channels*. Frequency, wavelength, velocity, Q-factor, coherence, amplitude —
these quantities are related through wave equations, so they tend to be
co-regulated. When one is moderate, the others are moderate.

**Why EM materials fail catastrophically** (IC/F = 0.065): The
conductor/insulator divide creates extreme channel heterogeneity. Copper has
σ ≈ 6×10⁷ S/m and ε_r ≈ 1. Glass has σ ≈ 10⁻¹² S/m and ε_r ≈ 7. The
conductivity channel spans **19 orders of magnitude** between conductors and
insulators. No normalization can erase this fundamental bimodality. It
triggers geometric slaughter at the material scale.

## Realization 7: The Universe Is Losing Integrity

**Receipt**: Cosmological epochs sorted by redshift (early → late):

| Epoch | z | F | IC | IC/F |
|-------|---|---|----|------|
| Inflation exit | ~10²⁵ | 0.621 | 0.002 | 0.003 |
| Recombination | 1100 | 0.467 | 0.023 | 0.050 |
| Dark energy onset | 0.70 | 0.583 | 0.223 | **0.383** |
| BAO epoch | 0.50 | 0.617 | 0.219 | 0.355 |
| SNe Ia epoch | 0.10 | 0.646 | 0.153 | 0.237 |
| Present (ΛCDM) | 0.00 | 0.649 | 0.009 | **0.014** |

The universe peaked in multiplicative coherence at the **dark energy onset**
(z ≈ 0.7, about 6.5 billion years ago). Since then, IC/F has dropped from
0.383 to 0.014 — a **27× collapse**.

**Fidelity keeps rising** (0.621 → 0.649). The universe preserves more
structure on average with time. But **integrity collapses** because Λ-domination
makes the cosmological trace vector progressively lopsided. Dark energy creates
a channel (Ω_Λ) that grows to dominate while others (Ω_b, Ω_c) shrink. The
geometric mean responds to this growing imbalance by collapsing.

**The universe is currently at its lowest-ever multiplicative coherence.**
IC/F = 0.014 means only 1.4% of the universe's average structure is backed
by balance across all cosmological channels. The arrow of cosmic decoherence
points forward in time.

## Realization 8: 10/10 Standard Model Theorems Proven

All 10 theorems from `particle_physics_formalism.py` pass with 74/74 subtests:

| # | Theorem | Tests | Key Number |
|---|---------|:-----:|------------|
| T1 | Spin-Statistics | 12/12 | ⟨F⟩_fermion > ⟨F⟩_boson |
| T2 | Generation Monotonicity | 5/5 | Gen1 < Gen2 < Gen3 |
| T3 | Confinement as IC Collapse | 19/19 | IC drops 98% quarks→hadrons |
| T4 | Mass-Kernel Log Mapping | 5/5 | Spearman ρ = 0.77 for quarks |
| T5 | Charge Quantization | 5/5 | IC_neutral/IC_charged = 0.020 |
| T6 | Cross-Scale Universality | 6/6 | composite < atom < fundamental |
| T7 | Symmetry Breaking | 5/5 | EWSB amplifies generation spread |
| T8 | CKM Unitarity | 5/5 | J_CP = 3.0×10⁻⁵ |
| T9 | Running Coupling Flow | 6/6 | α_s monotone Q ≥ 10 GeV |
| T10 | Nuclear Binding Curve | 6/6 | Peak at Cr/Fe (Z ∈ [23, 30]) |

The duality identity F + ω = 1 is verified to **0.0e+00 residual** across all
31 particles — not approximate, exact — because ω := 1 − F by construction.

## The Compounding Chain

Each realization is a consequence of the previous:

```
§1 F + ω = 1           The books always balance (duality)
    ↓
§2 IC ≤ F              ...but coherence can lag below the average (bound)
    ↓
§3 One dead channel    ...because ONE weak channel kills IC (geometric slaughter)
    ↓
R1 Confinement cliff   ...and this mechanism IS what confinement does (23× drop)
    ↓
R2 Atomic healing      ...but new degrees of freedom restore what was lost (35× recovery)
    ↓
R3 d-block supremacy   ...peaking in elements where ALL channels are balanced
    ↓
R4 Helium paradox      ...while simplicity kills coherence (inertness = dead channels)
    ↓
R5 Magic irrelevance   ...because improving one channel doesn't help if others are weak
    ↓
R6 Wave coherence      ...and systems with co-regulated channels achieve highest IC/F
    ↓
R7 Cosmic decoherence  ...while the universe's growing Λ destroys cross-channel balance
    ↓
R8 All 10 theorems     ...and none of this contradicts any Standard Model physics (74/74)
```

## Cross-Scale Connections

Three structural patterns recur at every scale:

### Pattern A: Geometric Slaughter Is Universal
- **Subatomic**: Color charge → ε in hadrons → IC cliff (R1)
- **Atomic**: Noble gas channels → ε → Helium IC = 0.007 (R4)
- **Materials**: Conductivity → ε for insulators → EM IC/F = 0.065 (R6)
- **Cosmological**: Ω_Λ dominance → other channels → ε → Universe IC/F = 0.014 (R7)

Same mechanism at every scale. One channel goes to ε, and the geometric
mean responds identically regardless of whether the channel represents
color charge, electronegativity, electrical conductivity, or dark energy
density. The mathematics does not care about the physics — it sees the
structure.

### Pattern B: Channel Balance > Channel Strength
- d-block elements (IC/F = 0.89) beat all other blocks despite not having
  the highest ionization energy or electronegativity
- Wave systems (IC/F > 0.93) beat all other everyday physics despite not
  having the highest individual channel values
- The Cartwheel galaxy has the highest IC in the universe because a collision
  *balanced* its channels, not because it increased any individual channel

Coherence is never about how strong any single property is. It is about
how evenly distributed all properties are across measurement channels.

### Pattern C: Scale Transitions Are Integrity Cliffs
- Quarks → Hadrons: IC/F drops 23× (R1)
- Hadrons → Atoms: IC/F rises 35× (R2)
- Atoms → Everyday: IC/F drops ~2× (mixed physics introduces heterogeneity)
- Dark energy onset → Present: IC/F drops 27× (R7)

Every major scale transition is visible as a cliff or recovery in IC/F.
The kernel makes scale transitions *measurable* as changes in multiplicative
coherence — and the direction of the change tells you whether the new scale
heals or breaks channel balance.
