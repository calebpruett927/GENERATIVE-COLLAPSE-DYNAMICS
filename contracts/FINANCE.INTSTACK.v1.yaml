  notes: >
    FINANCE.INTSTACK.v1 freezes the UMCP contract boundary for business financial
    continuity validation. Financial metrics (revenue performance, expense control,
    gross margin, cash flow health) are embedded as coordinates in [0,1]^4.
    Regime thresholds are calibrated for monthly business cadence:
    STABLE = within 5% of targets, WATCH = 5-20% deviation, COLLAPSE = >20%.
    Seam accounting certifies month-over-month financial continuity.
    The axiom applies: only financial health that returns through reporting collapse is real.

    regime_interpretation:
      STABLE: "Business operating within targets. Low drift, high fidelity."
      WATCH: "One or more metrics drifting. Review recommended."
      COLLAPSE: "Significant deviation from targets. Urgent action required."
      CRITICAL: "Integrity below 0.30. Financial health not demonstrable."
