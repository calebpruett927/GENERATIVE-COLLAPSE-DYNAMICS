  axioms:
  # Inherited from GCD
  - id: AX-0
    statement: Collapse is generative
    description: |
      Inherited from GCD Tier-1 (frozen). Nuclear decay IS generative collapse:
      the parent nucleus transitions to a more tightly bound configuration,
      releasing binding-energy deficit as kinetic energy of decay products.
      Every decay event generates particles (alpha, beta, gamma, neutrons)
      that carry the released energy. Φ_gen = ΔBE ≥ 0 for all spontaneous decays.
  - id: AX-1
    statement: Boundary defines interior
    description: |
      Inherited from GCD Tier-1 (frozen). The nuclear potential well
      (strong-force + Coulomb barrier) defines the bound-state interior.
      Shell closures (magic numbers) are boundary resonances that enhance
      binding. The Coulomb barrier height determines accessible decay modes.
  - id: AX-2
    statement: Entropy measures determinacy
    description: |
      Inherited from GCD Tier-1 (frozen). Nuclear entropy measures the
      system's distance from the binding-energy peak attractor.
      S ∝ (BE_peak - BE/A) = binding deficit from the Ni-62/Fe-56 peak.
      Higher S = less bound = more prone to collapse (decay).
  # Nuclear-specific axioms
  - id: AX-N0
    statement: The iron peak is the collapse attractor
    description: |
      The global maximum of binding energy per nucleon occurs at Ni-62
      (BE/A = 8.7945 MeV) with Fe-56 extremely close (8.7903 MeV).
      ALL nuclear processes — fusion (light side) and decay/fission
      (heavy side) — drive systems toward this attractor.
      In GCD terms: F_eff = 1 at the iron peak; ω_eff = 0.
      Every nuclear reaction with positive Q moves the system
      closer to the peak (lower ω_eff, higher F_eff).
  - id: AX-N1
    statement: Half-life is the return time of collapse
    description: |
      The mean lifetime τ = T½ / ln(2) of a radioactive nuclide
      is identified with the GCD return time τ_R. Each decay event
      is an individual collapse; the exponential decay law
      N(t) = N₀·exp(-t/τ) is the statistical shadow of independent
      collapse events occurring at rate λ = 1/τ.
      Stable nuclides: τ_R = INF_REC (already at attractor or within
      the stability basin). Unstable: τ_R = τ = T½/ln(2), finite.
      FROZEN: we use mean lifetime τ, not half-life T½.
  - id: AX-N2
    statement: Decay rate scales as Gamow tunneling
    description: |
      For alpha decay, the canonical scaling law is Geiger-Nuttall:
        log₁₀(T½) ≈ a(Z) / √Q_α + b(Z)
      where Q_α is the alpha-decay energy and a(Z), b(Z) are
      empirical constants within isotopic chains (Gamow 1928,
      Geiger & Nuttall 1911). The half-life is exponentially
      sensitive to 1/√Q_α, which is the Coulomb barrier penetration
      factor from WKB approximation.
      In GCD terms: the collapse time τ_R depends exponentially on
      the barrier height relative to the available energy — small
      energy differences produce astronomical τ_R variations.
  - id: AX-N3
    statement: Mass is the entropy reservoir
    description: |
      The mass (nucleon count A) serves as the reservoir that absorbs
      or generates entropy. On the light side (A < 62), adding nucleons
      increases BE/A (fusion is energetically favored). On the heavy side
      (A > 62), adding nucleons decreases BE/A — each nucleon adds more
      Coulomb entropy than the strong force can bind.
      The strong force saturates (~12 nearest neighbors, range ~1.4 fm).
      Coulomb repulsion is long-range (every proton repels every proton).
      Past the iron peak, mass itself becomes the entropy source.
  - id: AX-N4
    statement: Double-sided collapse converges on the attractor
    description: |
      Two gradients point toward the same peak:
        Light side: dBE/dA > 0 → fusion is downhill
        Heavy side: dBE/dA < 0 → fission/decay is downhill
      Both are GCD collapse processes: the system sheds entropy
      (binding deficit) by moving toward the attractor.
      Fusion = collapse upward through mass (combining sub-critical
      systems to gain stability). Decay = collapse downward through
      mass (shedding excess nucleons that the force cannot bind).
      This "double-sided collapse" is the nuclear realization of the
      stability window theorem: stability is not monotone in mass
      but exists in a band centered on the iron peak.

  notes: |
    NUC.INTSTACK.v1 extends GCD.INTSTACK.v1 with nuclear physics.

    FROZEN CHOICES (explicit, per feedback):
    1. LIFETIME: mean lifetime τ = T½/ln(2), NOT half-life T½.
       τ is the natural 1/e decay constant; T½ is the median.
    2. PEAK REFERENCE: Ni-62 at BE/A = 8.7945 MeV/nucleon.
       Fe-56 at 8.7903 is extremely close but Ni-62 is the true maximum.
    3. DECAY SCALING: Geiger-Nuttall form log₁₀(T½) = a/√Q_α + b,
       NOT 1/ΔBE. The Gamow tunneling factor gives 1/√Q dependence.
    4. Q-VALUE DEFINITION: Q_α = M_parent - M_daughter - M_He4 (in MeV),
       NOT vague "ΔBE/A from peak." Q is what controls barrier penetration.

    The six closures cover:
    1. Nuclide binding (SEMF, BE/A normalization, ω_eff)
    2. Alpha decay dynamics (Geiger-Nuttall, Q-value, mean lifetime)
    3. Decay chain traversal (multi-step collapse cascade)
    4. Fissility assessment (Coulomb vs surface competition)
    5. Shell structure (magic numbers, shell corrections)
    6. Double-sided collapse overlay (signed distance to peak, convergence)

    Each closure maps nuclear observables to GCD invariants:
    - ω_eff = 1 - BE_per_A/BE_peak_ref (binding deficit = drift)
    - F_eff = BE_per_A/BE_peak_ref (binding fraction = fidelity)
    - τ_R = τ = T½/ln(2) (mean lifetime = return time)
    - S ∝ (BE_peak - BE/A) (entropy ∝ binding deficit)
    - Ψ_BE(k) is the normalized trace channel for binding
    - Ψ_fiss(k) is the normalized fissility proxy Z²/A
    - Ψ_Q(k) is the normalized Q_alpha for alpha steps
    - Ψ_logτ(k) is the normalized log lifetime

    The double-sided collapse overlay (O.NUC.DOUBLEFACE.v1) tests
    whether trajectories from both sides of the iron peak converge
    in the signed distance-to-peak coordinate. This is the
    falsifiable prediction: if convergence disappears under alternate
    frozen choices (Q proxy, peak reference, lifetime constant),
    it is not kernel-robust.
