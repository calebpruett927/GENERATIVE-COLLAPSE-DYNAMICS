  axioms:
  # Inherited from GCD
  - id: AX-0
    statement: Collapse is generative
    description: |
      Inherited from GCD Tier-1 (frozen). Every collapse event releases generative
      potential. In quantum mechanics: wavefunction collapse upon measurement is the
      literal archetype of generative collapse — the indefinite superposition
      resolves into a definite outcome, generating observable reality.
      Φ_gen ≥ 0 always. Measurement doesn't destroy information; it generates
      the classical world from quantum potentiality.
  - id: AX-1
    statement: Boundary defines interior
    description: |
      Inherited from GCD Tier-1 (frozen). Boundary conditions fully determine
      interior dynamics. In QM: the boundary conditions of the potential well
      determine the allowed wavefunctions and energy eigenvalues.
      Measurement apparatus (boundary) defines what can be observed (interior).
  - id: AX-2
    statement: Entropy measures determinacy
    description: |
      Inherited from GCD Tier-1 (frozen). S quantifies system indeterminacy.
      In QM: von Neumann entropy S_vN = -Tr(ρ log ρ) measures the mixedness
      of the quantum state. Pure states (S_vN = 0) have full determinacy;
      maximally mixed states have maximum indeterminacy.
  # Quantum mechanics-specific axioms
  - id: AX-Q0
    statement: Born rule governs measurement outcomes
    description: |
      The probability of obtaining measurement outcome |φ⟩ from state |ψ⟩
      is given by P = |⟨φ|ψ⟩|². This is the fundamental bridge between
      quantum amplitudes and observable statistics.
      In UMCP terms: Born rule violation (delta_P) maps directly to drift ω.
      Perfect Born compliance (delta_P = 0) means F = 1 (full fidelity).
      This axiom is the QM realization of AX-0: collapse generates the
      probability distribution that becomes the observable.
  - id: AX-Q1
    statement: Entanglement is non-local correlation
    description: |
      For entangled states, Bell's inequality S_CHSH > 2 demonstrates
      correlations exceeding any local hidden-variable theory. Concurrence
      C ∈ [0,1] quantifies entanglement strength; C = 0 is separable,
      C = 1 is maximally entangled.
      In UMCP terms: entanglement maps to coupling C in the kernel.
      High concurrence = high coupling = departure from independent components.
      Bell violation is the QM realization of non-trivial correlations
      that cannot be factored into boundary effects alone.
  - id: AX-Q2
    statement: Tunneling transcends classical barriers
    description: |
      A particle with energy E < V₀ can penetrate a potential barrier
      with transmission coefficient T = exp(-2κL), where κ = √(2m(V₀-E))/ℏ.
      This is impossible in classical mechanics.
      In UMCP terms: tunneling represents generative collapse through
      classically forbidden regions. The barrier is the boundary (AX-1),
      and the tunneling probability measures how the quantum interior
      transcends the classical boundary constraint.
  - id: AX-Q3
    statement: Uncertainty bounds joint measurements
    description: |
      Heisenberg uncertainty: Δx·Δp ≥ ℏ/2. No measurement can simultaneously
      determine conjugate observables with arbitrary precision.
      In UMCP terms: the uncertainty product normalized by ℏ/2 (heisenberg_ratio)
      must always be ≥ 1. This is a fundamental kernel constraint —
      the system entropy S cannot be zero for conjugate observables.
      Violations indicate measurement error (NONCONFORMANT), not physics.

  notes: |
    QM.INTSTACK.v1 extends GCD.INTSTACK.v1 with quantum mechanics.
    Quantum mechanics is the original and most natural domain for Generative
    Collapse Dynamics: wavefunction collapse upon measurement is the literal
    archetype of the GCD axiom "Collapse is generative."

    The six closures cover the foundational pillars of quantum mechanics:
    1. Wavefunction collapse & Born rule (measurement theory)
    2. Entanglement & Bell inequalities (non-local correlations)
    3. Quantum tunneling (barrier penetration)
    4. Harmonic oscillator (energy quantization)
    5. Spin measurement & Zeeman effect (discrete observables)
    6. Heisenberg uncertainty principle (conjugate variable bounds)

    Each closure maps quantum observables to UMCP invariants (ω, F, S, C)
    through physically motivated embeddings. The UMCP regime classification
    (Stable/Watch/Collapse) maps onto quantum coherence regimes:
    Stable = coherent/faithful, Watch = perturbed/mixed, Collapse = decoherent.
