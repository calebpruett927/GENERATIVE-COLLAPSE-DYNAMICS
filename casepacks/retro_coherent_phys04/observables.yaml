# Physical Interpretation
interpretation:
  paradox_resolution: |
    The negative excitation time is not a causality violation but a
    lawful retro-coherent return seam. Under postselection, the ensemble
    exhibits phase-preserving excitation that precedes the pulse peak.
    This is the signature of AX-0: collapse is generative, and the
    curvature-reversed return completes the epistemic ledger.

  key_insight: |
    What appears as "atoms un-exciting before being excited" is
    reinterpreted as: the return delay τR < 0 exactly balances
    the curvature change DC < 0, yielding Δκ = 0 and s = 0.
    The system satisfies all Type I seam criteria.
