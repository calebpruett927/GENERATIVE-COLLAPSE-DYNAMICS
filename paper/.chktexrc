# chktex configuration for UMCP papers
# Suppress false positives from revtex4-2, math mode, and custom macros

# 1: "Command terminated with space" — false positive on custom macros
#    (\IC, \beq, \eeq, \sum, \prod, etc.) used in math mode
CmdSpaceStyle = ignore

# 3: "Enclose parenthesis with {}" — false positive on math brackets
#    like [\eps, 1-\eps]^n
MathEnvir { alignat }

# 8: "Wrong length of dash" — false positive on minus signs in math
#    like F - \IC or revtex4-2 in document class
# 24: "Delete space for page references" — newline between \section
#     and \label is standard practice
# 36: "Space in front of parenthesis" — valid in math like c(1-c)
# 44: "User Regex" — \hline in ruledtabular is standard revtex
