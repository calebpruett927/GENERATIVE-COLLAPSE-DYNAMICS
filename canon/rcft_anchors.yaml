  description: |
    Recursive Collapse Field Theory (RCFT) is a Tier-2 overlay on GCD that analyzes
    recursive patterns, fractal structures, and field dynamics in collapse events.
    RCFT augments GCD's Tier-1 invariants with advanced geometric and topological metrics
    without modifying or overriding the frozen Tier-1 foundation.

tier_hierarchy:
  description: |
    RCFT operates as Tier-2, meaning:
    - Cannot redefine or override Tier-1 symbols (ω, F, S, C, τ_R, κ, IC, IC_min, I)
    - Cannot modify GCD axioms (AX-0, AX-1, AX-2)
    - Can only augment with new Tier-2 symbols and metrics
    - Must respect all GCD regime classifications and tolerances
  
  tier_1_frozen_symbols:

    - F        # Fidelity (GCD Tier-1)
    - S        # Entropy (GCD Tier-1)
    - C        # Curvature (GCD Tier-1)
    - τ_R      # Relaxation timescale (GCD Tier-1)
    - κ        # Log-collapse indicator (GCD Tier-1)
    - IC       # Integrity coefficient (GCD Tier-1)
    - IC_min   # Minimum integrity (GCD Tier-1)
    - I        # General integrity (GCD Tier-1)

principles:
  - id: "P-RCFT-0"
    statement: "Tier-2 augments, never overrides"
    description: |
      RCFT adds new dimensions of analysis without modifying GCD's Tier-1 foundation.
      All Tier-1 invariants remain frozen and unchanged.
  
  - id: "P-RCFT-1"
    statement: "Recursion reveals hidden structure"
    description: |
      Collapse events exhibit recursive patterns across scales. RCFT metrics quantify
      these self-similar structures through fractal dimension and recursive field analysis.
  
  - id: "P-RCFT-2"
    statement: "Fields carry collapse memory"
    description: |
      The collapse field Ψ encodes history of prior collapse events. Recursive analysis
      reveals how past collapses influence future dynamics through field memory.

notes: |
  RCFT is a Tier-2 overlay that analyzes geometric and topological properties of
  collapse trajectories without modifying GCD's Tier-1 invariants. It provides:
  - Fractal dimension analysis (D_f) for trajectory complexity
  - Recursive field strength (Ψ_r) for collapse memory quantification
  - Pattern wavelength (λ_p) for oscillation scale analysis
  - Phase coherence (Θ) for recursive field synchronization
  
  All RCFT metrics are computed from Tier-1 invariants and do not replace them.
  GCD axioms (AX-0, AX-1, AX-2) remain authoritative for all collapse analysis.
