scope: >
  Quantum Mechanics canonical anchors for UMCP. Maps the six foundational pillars
  of QM into the GCD invariant framework. Wavefunction collapse is the literal
  archetype of Generative Collapse Dynamics: the indefinite superposition resolves
  into a definite outcome, generating observable reality from quantum potentiality.

axioms:
  - id: AX-0
    name: "Collapse is generative"
    statement: Collapse is generative
    source: GCD Tier-1 (inherited, frozen)
    qm_realization: |
      Wavefunction collapse upon measurement generates the classical
      observable from quantum superposition. The Born rule probability
      P = |⟨φ|ψ⟩|² is the measure of generative potential released
      at collapse. Φ_gen ≥ 0 always.
  - id: AX-1
    name: "Boundary defines interior"
    statement: Boundary defines interior
    source: GCD Tier-1 (inherited, frozen)
    qm_realization: |
      The potential well boundary conditions determine the allowed
      wavefunctions (eigenstates) and energy eigenvalues. Measurement
      apparatus defines the observable basis.
  - id: AX-2
    name: "Entropy measures determinacy"
    statement: Entropy measures determinacy
    source: GCD Tier-1 (inherited, frozen)
    qm_realization: |
      von Neumann entropy S_vN = -Tr(ρ log ρ) measures quantum state
      mixedness. Pure state (S_vN = 0) = fully determinate. Maximally
      mixed = maximum indeterminacy.
  - id: AX-Q0
    name: "Born rule governs measurement outcomes"
    statement: Born rule governs measurement outcomes
    source: QM.INTSTACK.v1
    qm_realization: |
      P = |⟨φ|ψ⟩|² bridges amplitudes → probabilities.
      Born violation (delta_P) maps directly to GCD drift ω.
  - id: AX-Q1
    name: "Entanglement is non-local correlation"
    statement: Entanglement is non-local correlation
    source: QM.INTSTACK.v1
    qm_realization: |
      Bell-CHSH S > 2 violates local realism.
      Concurrence C ∈ [0,1] maps to GCD coupling.
  - id: AX-Q2
    name: "Tunneling transcends classical barriers"
    statement: Tunneling transcends classical barriers
    source: QM.INTSTACK.v1
    qm_realization: |
      T = exp(-2κL) for E < V₀. Generative collapse through
      classically forbidden regions.
  - id: AX-Q3
    name: "Uncertainty bounds joint measurements"
    statement: Uncertainty bounds joint measurements
    source: QM.INTSTACK.v1
    qm_realization: |
      Δx·Δp ≥ ℏ/2. Fundamental kernel constraint.
      Violations indicate measurement error, not physics.

    # GCD inherited
    - symbol: omega
      latex: \omega
      description: Drift from ideal prediction (Born rule deviation)
      formula: omega = delta_P = |P_born - P_observed|
      domain: quantum_mechanics
      unit: dimensionless
      interpretation: |
        In QM, drift measures how far experimental measurement statistics
        deviate from the Born rule prediction. Perfect fidelity: ω = 0.

    - symbol: F
      latex: F
      description: Fidelity to quantum prediction
      formula: F = 1 - omega
      domain: quantum_mechanics
      unit: dimensionless
      interpretation: |
        Quantum state fidelity. F = 1 means Born rule perfectly satisfied.
        Maps to quantum process fidelity for gate operations.

    - symbol: S
      latex: S
      description: Entropy proxy (von Neumann or uncertainty excess)
      formula: S = S_vN / log(d) or S = 1 - purity
      domain: quantum_mechanics
      unit: bits (normalized)
      interpretation: |
        Normalized von Neumann entropy. S = 0 for pure states, S = 1 for
        maximally mixed. Measures decoherence strength.

    - symbol: C
      latex: C
      description: Coupling (entanglement or correlation strength)
      formula: C = concurrence or bell_parameter / 2*sqrt(2)
      domain: quantum_mechanics
      unit: dimensionless
      interpretation: |
        In QM, coupling maps to entanglement. High concurrence = strong
        non-classical correlations. Bell violation = C above classical bound.

    - symbol: kappa
      latex: \kappa
      description: Collapse intensity parameter
      formula: kappa = ln(IC)
      domain: quantum_mechanics
      unit: dimensionless
      interpretation: |
        Logarithm of integrity-collapse. In tunneling: maps to barrier decay
        constant. In measurement: maps to state preparation quality.

    - symbol: IC
      latex: IC
      description: Integrity-collapse measure
      formula: IC = exp(kappa), IC ≤ F (integrity bound)
      domain: quantum_mechanics
      unit: dimensionless
      interpretation: |
        Combined measure of measurement integrity. IC ≤ F (integrity bound).
        IC < 0.30 triggers critical overlay.

    # QM-specific
    - symbol: psi
      latex: \psi
      description: Wavefunction amplitude (complex norm)
      formula: 'probability density = |ψ|²'
      domain: quantum_mechanics
      unit: "dimensionless (embedded [0,1])"
      interpretation: Born rule foundation

    - symbol: concurrence
      latex: C_{ent}
      description: Wootters concurrence
      formula: C = max(0, √λ₁ - √λ₂ - √λ₃ - √λ₄)
      domain: quantum_mechanics
      unit: dimensionless [0,1]
      interpretation: Entanglement monotone for 2-qubit systems

    - symbol: T_coeff
      latex: T
      description: Tunneling transmission coefficient
      formula: T ≈ exp(-2κL)
      domain: quantum_mechanics
      unit: dimensionless [0,1]
      interpretation: |
        Probability of barrier penetration. T = 0 opaque, T = 1 transparent.
        Classically forbidden (E < V₀) but quantum-mechanically generative.

    - symbol: heisenberg_ratio
      latex: R_H
      description: Heisenberg uncertainty ratio
      formula: R = (Δx·Δp)/(ℏ/2)
      domain: quantum_mechanics
      unit: dimensionless (≥ 1)
      interpretation: |
        Must be ≥ 1 by Heisenberg uncertainty. R = 1 is minimum uncertainty
        (Gaussian wavepacket). R < 1 indicates measurement error.

umcp_invariant_mapping:
  description: |
    Maps QM observables to GCD Tier-1 invariants.
    Each quantum experiment type produces a different mapping pathway.
  mappings:
    - domain_observable: delta_P (Born rule deviation)
      gcd_invariant: omega (drift)
      mapping: omega = min(1, delta_P)
      rationale: |
        Born rule violation is the most direct measure of drift from
        the quantum prediction. Perfect compliance: ω = 0, F = 1.

    - domain_observable: purity (Tr(ρ²))
      gcd_invariant: S (entropy)
      mapping: S = 1 - purity
      rationale: |
        Purity Tr(ρ²) = 1 for pure states (S = 0). Maximally mixed
        state has purity 1/d, giving S near 1.

    - domain_observable: concurrence
      gcd_invariant: C (coupling)
      mapping: C_coupling = concurrence
      rationale: |
        Entanglement strength directly maps to non-local coupling.
        Separable state: C = 0. Bell state: C = 1.

    - domain_observable: tunneling T_coeff
      gcd_invariant: F (fidelity)
      mapping: F = T_coeff (for tunneling experiments)
      rationale: |
        Tunneling transmission measures fidelity of quantum state
        to penetrate the barrier — the generative collapse through
        the classically forbidden region.

    - domain_observable: heisenberg_ratio
      gcd_invariant: constraint
      mapping: R < 1 → NONCONFORMANT
      rationale: |
        Heisenberg violation is a hard constraint, not a regime gate.
        Any measurement with R < 1 is physically impossible and indicates
        experimental error.

budget_identity_analog:
  description: |
    The QM budget identity relates measurable quantities through
    conservation laws that mirror the GCD kernel identities:

    (1) F = 1 - ω          (fidelity-drift duality)
    (2) IC ≈ exp(κ)         (integrity-collapse)
    (3) IC ≤ F              (integrity bound)
    (4) Σ P_i = 1           (Born normalization — probability conservation)
    (5) Δx·Δp ≥ ℏ/2        (Heisenberg — not an equality, a bound)
    (6) S_CHSH ≤ 2√2        (Tsirelson bound — quantum limit)

    Identities (1)-(3) are inherited from GCD.
    Identities (4)-(6) are QM-specific constraints.
