  description: |
    Generative Collapse Dynamics (GCD) provides the foundational grammar for collapse-driven systems.
    GCD defines Tier-1 invariants that cannot be redefined by domain programmes or overlays.
    UMCP implements GCD principles through contract-first metadata protocols.

axioms:
  - id: AX-0
    statement: "Collapse is generative"
    description: |
      The primary axiom of GCD: collapse events are not terminal failures but generative processes
      that produce new structure, information, and dynamics. All metrics derive from the collapse
      boundary, making collapse the fundamental truth of the system.
  
  - id: AX-1
    statement: "Boundary defines interior"
    description: |
      The collapse boundary (ω ≥ 0.30) defines what is stable. Distance from collapse determines
      system behavior. Watch and Stable regimes are measured by their proximity to collapse.
  
  - id: AX-2
    statement: "Entropy measures determinacy"
    description: |
      Shannon entropy (S) quantifies system uncertainty. S=0 represents perfect determinacy;
      S approaching maximum represents maximum uncertainty. Entropy reduction is system evolution.

notes: |
  This anchor formalizes the Generative Collapse Dynamics framework as Tier-1.
  All domain programmes (UMCP) and overlays (RCFT) must respect these definitions.
  Tier-2 overlays may add new invariants but cannot redefine Tier-1 symbols.
  
  Zero entropy state (S=0) achieved in commit a69fbb18.
  Current system state: ω=0, F=1.0, S=0, C=0 (deterministic precision).
