  description: |
    Kinematics Extension provides a physics-based layer for motion within UMCP.
    Maps classical mechanics (position, velocity, acceleration, energy, momentum)
    to UMCP's return axiom via phase space (x,v).

axioms:
  - id: KIN-AX-0
    statement: "Phase Space Closure"
    description: |
      Every kinematic observable must map to a point in phase space Γ_kin.
      Γ_kin = {(x, v) : x ∈ [0,1], v ∈ [0,1]}

  - id: KIN-AX-1
    statement: "Return Time Finiteness"
    description: |
      For periodic motion: τ_kin < ∞ (motion returns through phase space).
      For drifting motion: τ_kin = INF_KIN (motion never returns).
      This connects to UMCP's core axiom: "What returns is real."

  - id: KIN-AX-2
    statement: "Conservation Closure"
    description: |
      Conserved quantities (momentum, mechanical energy in conservative systems)
      define invariant subspaces in phase space.

  - id: KIN-AX-3
    statement: "Stability Finiteness"
    description: |
      Stable motion satisfies K_stability ∈ [0, 1].
      K_stability → 1 indicates equilibrium convergence.
      K_stability → 0 indicates instability/divergence.
