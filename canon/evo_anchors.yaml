  Canon anchors for the evolution domain closure.
  Maps biological evolution to GCD Tier-1 invariants through 40 organisms
  across the tree of life, 20 evolutionary phenomena as collapse-return
  cycles, 5 nested recursive scales (Gene → Clade), and 5 mass extinctions.
  Demonstrates that evolution IS recursive collapse-return: natural selection
  is the collapse operator, fitness is fidelity, mutation is drift.

axioms:
  - id: "AX-EVO0"
    name: "Evolutionary Duality"
    statement: >
      Natural selection partitions the reproductive budget exhaustively:
      what selection retains (F) + what it removes (ω) = 1.
      Fisher's Fundamental Theorem [Fisher 1930] is the population genetics
      expression of the duality identity. No third reservoir exists.
    frozen: true

  - id: "AX-EVO1"
    name: "Geometric Slaughter (Purifying Selection)"
    statement: >
      IC ≤ F: organism coherence (geometric mean fitness across traits)
      cannot exceed mean trait fitness (arithmetic mean). One near-zero
      channel drives IC toward ε regardless of other channels. This IS
      purifying selection — one lethal trait kills the lineage even if
      all other traits are excellent. The Dodo exemplifies this:
      environmental_breadth → ε → geometric slaughter → τ_R = ∞_rec.
    frozen: true

  - id: "AX-EVO2"
    name: "Scale-Invariant Kernel"
    statement: >
      The same GCD kernel (F, ω, S, C, κ, IC) applies identically at
      Gene, Organism, Population, Species, and Clade scales. Collapse
      at one scale generates the signal for the next. IC degrades from
      Gene (0.694) → Clade (0.469) as channel heterogeneity increases
      with each level of organization.
    frozen: true

  - id: "AX-EVO3"
    name: "Mass Extinction as Collapse-Return"
    statement: >
      Every mass extinction is a collapse event with measurable IC cliff.
      The End-Permian (252 Ma) produced an 80.1% IC drop — near-total
      geometric slaughter. Recovery radiations (the return) generate
      novel morphological disparity exceeding pre-extinction levels
      [Erwin 2001, Sepkoski 1984]. Ruptura est fons constantiae.
    frozen: true

  - id: "AX-EVO4"
    name: "Extinction as τ_R = ∞_rec"
    statement: >
      An extinct lineage has τ_R = ∞_rec — permanent detention with
      no return. The lineage is a gestus, not a sutura. Extinct species
      (Trilobita, Dodo, T. rex) carry zero budget credit. Whether Homo
      sapiens achieves finite τ_R is the open question of the domain.
