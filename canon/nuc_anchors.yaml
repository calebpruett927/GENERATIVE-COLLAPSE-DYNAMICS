  hierarchy: GCD → NUC (Tier-1)
  description: |
    Nuclear Physics canonical anchors for UMCP.
    Maps nuclear binding, decay dynamics, shell structure, and fissility
    into the GCD invariant framework.  The iron peak (Ni-62, BE/A = 8.7945
    MeV/nucleon) serves as the collapse attractor, with both fusion (light
    side) and decay/fission (heavy side) converging on it — the "double-
    sided collapse" (AX-N4).

    Frozen choices (per expert review, 2026-02-08):
      - Lifetime: mean lifetime τ = T½/ln(2), not half-life T½
      - Peak reference: Ni-62 at 8.7945 MeV/nucleon (not Fe-56)
      - Decay scaling: Geiger-Nuttall log₁₀(T½) = a/√Q_α + b
      - SEMF coefficients: a_V=15.67, a_S=17.23, a_C=0.714, a_A=23.29, a_P=11.2

axioms:
  - id: AX-0
    statement: Collapse is generative
    source: GCD Tier-1 (inherited, frozen)
    nuc_realization: |
      Nuclear binding energy release (both fusion and fission) is the
      literal generation of energy from mass deficit.  E = Δm·c².
      The strong force generates stability by binding nucleons into
      configurations of decreasing mass-per-nucleon.

  - id: AX-1
    statement: Boundary defines interior
    source: GCD Tier-1 (inherited, frozen)
    nuc_realization: |
      The nuclear potential well (Saxon-Woods) defines the shell
      structure (magic numbers, spin-orbit splitting).  The Coulomb
      barrier defines the boundary for alpha decay and fission.

  - id: AX-2
    statement: Entropy measures determinacy
    source: GCD Tier-1 (inherited, frozen)
    nuc_realization: |
      Nuclear entropy is primarily Coulomb repulsion vs surface tension.
      High-Z nuclei (Z > 82) have increasingly disordered Coulomb fields
      relative to the strong force binding, driving radioactive decay.

  - id: AX-N0
    statement: Iron peak is the collapse attractor
    source: NUC.INTSTACK.v1
    nuc_realization: |
      Ni-62 (BE/A = 8.7945 MeV/nucleon) is the global maximum of
      binding energy per nucleon.  All nuclear processes — fusion for
      A < 62, decay/fission for A > 62 — move toward this peak in
      the thermodynamic limit.

  - id: AX-N1
    statement: Half-life is the return time τ_R
    source: NUC.INTSTACK.v1
    nuc_realization: |
      Mean lifetime τ = T½/ln(2) maps directly to the GCD return time.
      τ_R → ∞ for stable nuclei (permanent return).
      τ_R → 0 for superheavy elements (immediate collapse).
      Frozen choice: use mean lifetime, not half-life.

  - id: AX-N2
    statement: Gamow tunneling governs decay scaling
    source: NUC.INTSTACK.v1
    nuc_realization: |
      log₁₀(T½) = a(Z)/√Q_α + b(Z)  (Geiger-Nuttall).
      The alpha particle tunnels through the Coulomb barrier; tunneling
      probability is exponentially sensitive to Q_α (decay energy).
      This is the SAME quantum tunneling from QM closures, applied to
      the nuclear Coulomb barrier.

  - id: AX-N3
    statement: Mass is an entropy reservoir (substrate axiom)
    source: NUC.INTSTACK.v1
    nuc_realization: |
      Nucleon count A determines total available binding budget.
      More massive nuclei can host more entropy channels (Coulomb,
      surface, asymmetry, pairing).  The balance of these channels
      determines stability.

  - id: AX-N4
    statement: Collapse converges from both sides
    source: NUC.INTSTACK.v1
    nuc_realization: |
      Light-side (A < 62): fusion increases A, moves toward peak.
      Heavy-side (A > 62): decay/fission decreases A, moves toward peak.
      The iron peak is the unique stable fixed point of the binding
      energy landscape.  This is the Double-Sided Collapse.

    - symbol: omega
      latex: \omega
      description: Drift from Ni-62 peak binding (binding deficit)
      formula: omega_eff = 1 - BE_per_A / 8.7945
      domain: nuclear_physics
      unit: dimensionless
      interpretation: |
        Nuclear drift measures how far a nuclide's binding energy per
        nucleon falls below the Ni-62 peak.  ω = 0 at peak.

    - symbol: F
      latex: F
      description: Fidelity to peak binding
      formula: F_eff = BE_per_A / 8.7945
      domain: nuclear_physics
      unit: dimensionless
      interpretation: |
        Fraction of peak binding achieved.  F = 1 at Ni-62.
        F < 0.85 indicates significant binding deficit.

    - symbol: S
      latex: S
      description: Entropy proxy (Coulomb disorder)
      formula: S_nuc = coulomb_fraction / total_binding
      domain: nuclear_physics

      latex: C
      description: Coupling (shell closure strength)
      formula: C_shell = shell_correction / reference
      domain: nuclear_physics
      unit: dimensionless
      interpretation: |
        Shell effects as coupling.  Magic numbers produce large
        shell corrections (extra stability).

    - symbol: kappa
      latex: \kappa
      description: Collapse intensity parameter
      formula: kappa = ln(IC)
      domain: nuclear_physics
      unit: dimensionless
      interpretation: |
        Logarithm of integrity-collapse.  In nuclear context: maps
        to barrier penetrability and decay urgency.

    - symbol: IC
      latex: IC
      description: Integrity-collapse measure
      formula: IC = exp(kappa), IC ≤ F (AM-GM bound)
      domain: nuclear_physics

      description: Binding energy per nucleon
      formula: BE_per_A = BE_total / A (MeV/nucleon)
      domain: nuclear_physics
      unit: MeV/nucleon
      interpretation: |
        The fundamental nuclear stability measure.  Maximum at Ni-62
        (8.7945 MeV/nucleon).  SEMF provides smooth estimate; AME2020
        provides measured values.

    - symbol: Q_alpha
      latex: Q_\alpha
      description: Alpha decay energy
      formula: Q_alpha = M_parent - M_daughter - M_He4 (MeV)
      domain: nuclear_physics
      unit: MeV
      interpretation: |
        Kinetic energy released in alpha decay.  Q > 0 means alpha
        decay is energetically allowed.  Controls tunneling rate.

    - symbol: fissility_x
      latex: x
      description: Fissility parameter
      formula: x = (Z²/A) / (Z²/A)_crit
      domain: nuclear_physics
      unit: dimensionless
      interpretation: |
        Competition between Coulomb repulsion and surface tension.
        x = 1: barrier vanishes (spontaneous fission).
        x < 0.7: subfissile (rare fission).

    - symbol: tau_mean
      latex: \tau
      description: Mean lifetime
      formula: tau = T_half / ln(2)
      domain: nuclear_physics
      unit: seconds
      interpretation: |
        Mean lifetime (1/e decay constant).  Frozen choice: use τ,
        not T½, per Clement Paulus review 2026-02-08.

umcp_invariant_mapping:
  description: |
    Maps nuclear observables to GCD Tier-1 invariants.
    The primary mapping axis is binding deficit → drift.
  mappings:
    - domain_observable: BE_per_A (binding energy per nucleon)
      gcd_invariant: omega (drift)
      mapping: omega_eff = max(0, 1 - BE_per_A / 8.7945)
      rationale: |
        Binding deficit from peak is the nuclear meaning of drift.
        Higher deficit → higher ω → less stable.

    - domain_observable: fissility_x
      gcd_invariant: S (entropy proxy)
      mapping: S_nuc proportional to fissility
      rationale: |
        Fissility measures Coulomb disorder vs binding cohesion.
        High fissility → high entropy → collapse imminent.

    - domain_observable: shell_correction
      gcd_invariant: C (coupling)
      mapping: C_shell = |shell_correction| / reference
      rationale: |
        Shell effects create extra stability at magic numbers,
        analogous to non-local correlations in QM.

    - domain_observable: Q_alpha (decay energy)
      gcd_invariant: barrier height
      mapping: Geiger-Nuttall log₁₀(T½) = a/√Q_α + b
      rationale: |
        Q_α controls Coulomb barrier penetration.  Higher Q → thinner
        barrier → faster decay → shorter τ.

    - domain_observable: tau_mean (mean lifetime)
      gcd_invariant: tau_R (return time)
      mapping: tau_R = tau_mean = T½/ln(2)
      rationale: |
        Mean lifetime IS the return time.  τ → ∞ for stable nuclei.
        τ → 0 for superheavy elements.

    Nuclear budget identities mirror GCD kernel identities:

    (1) F_eff = 1 − ω_eff                 (fidelity-drift duality)
    (2) IC ≈ exp(κ)                        (integrity-collapse)
    (3) IC ≤ F                             (AM-GM bound)
