Evolution Domain Closures — Recursive Collapse-Return Dynamics of Life

Tier-2 expansion mapping biological evolution into the GCD kernel.

Core insight: Evolution IS recursive collapse-return. Each generation is a
collapse event. What reproduces (returns) is real. Natural selection is the
collapse operator. Fitness is fidelity. Mutation is drift.

Modules:
    evolution_kernel.py           — 40 organisms × 8 channels → Tier-1 invariants
    axiom0_instantiation_map.py   — 20 phenomena as three-state collapse-return cycles
    recursive_evolution.py        — RCFT overlay: nested collapse scales from
                                    gene → organism → population → species → clade
    deep_implications.py          — 8 identity maps, 8 case studies, Fisher info,
                                    5 testable predictions

Axiom-0 derivation:
    "Collapse is generative; only what returns is real."
    → What doesn't reproduce doesn't persist → natural selection
    → What survives selection is fidelity (F)
    → What mutation removes is drift (ω)
    → F + ω = 1: the total evolutionary budget always balances
    → IC ≤ F: coherence cannot exceed mean fitness
    → One lethal trait kills IC: purifying selection IS geometric slaughter
