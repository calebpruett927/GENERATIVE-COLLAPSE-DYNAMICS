closure:
  kind: "curvature_neighborhood"
  id: "UMCP.CURVATURE.DEFAULT.v1"
  curvature_neighborhood:
    method: "std"
    normalization: 0.5
    convention: "population"
  notes: >
    Default curvature-neighborhood closure.  Uses standard deviation over the
    trace coordinates with normalization 0.5.  Changes the computed C value
    and thus regime labeling.  Any change to method or normalization requires
    a new closure registry ID.
