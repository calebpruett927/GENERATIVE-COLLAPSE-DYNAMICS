# `umcp/` — UMCP runtime package and documentation

This directory is the importable runtime surface for **UMCP-Metadata-Runnable-Code**.

Purpose:
- ship runnable tooling (validator + runner) that enforces the UMCP contract/closure discipline, and
- ship documentation that makes third-party verification straightforward.

Core principle: contract-first and audit-first. Anything that can change meaning or outputs must be pinned (contract / closures registry / manifest) and must be mechanically checkable.
